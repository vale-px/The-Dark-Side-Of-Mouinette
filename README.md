# The-Dark-Side-Of-Mouinette
A personal moulinette to check Libft Project of 42 School Common Core

Here few things before to test:

  - You must have installed python 3
  - You must have installed pip
  - You must have installed pytest
  - You must have done the Makefile with the function that you made.
  - DONT PUT ON YOUR MAKEFILE FT_FUNCITON THAT YOU DON'T MAKE YET.
  
Once u have download the repo, copy everythings in your libft dir. 
From your terminal, move to your libft dir with the command cd.

Follow the next commands:
 
# chmod 775 ./to_run
# ./to_run.sh

The script will automatically compile and start all the tests.

If you have any issue, you can write me here on Github.
